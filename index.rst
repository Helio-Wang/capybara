Welcome to Quokka's documentation!
=======================================

Quokka has some features in common with its predecessor |EUCALPYT| [1]_: counting the number of optimal reconciliations, listing optimal reconciliations to a file, keeping only the acyclic ones (the definition of cyclicity is taken from [2]_).


.. sidebar:: Wow! New features!

    .. image:: resources/quokka.jpg

Quokka also has some **exciting new features**: 

- Counting and enumeration of even vectors, event partitions, equivalence classes (see the :ref:`Enumeration tasks` in :ref:`Optimal enumeration`)

- Enumeration of suboptimal reconciliations (see :ref:`Suboptimal enumeration`)

- Animated visualization of event partitions and equivalence classes (see :ref:`Output visualization`)
