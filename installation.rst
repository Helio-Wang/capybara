Download
--------

`Click here to get Capybara <https://github.com/Helio-Wang/Capybara-app/releases/latest>`__.

You can find the binary executables of Capybara for the following OS:

  - Microsoft Windows 10
  - macOs
  - Ubuntu (>=17.04)
  - Arch Linux

Please note that no additional installation is required. Just unzip and run the binary!


Build
----- 

The source code is available at https://github.com/Helio-Wang/Capybara-app.

You may want to build Capybara from source if

  - You are not using one of the supported OS (Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, Arch), or
  - You have made some changes to the source code.


First, clone or create the project directory and

.. code:: console

   cd Capybara-app

Capybara includes a ``Pipfile`` specifying all requirements, generated by the virtual environment management tool Pipenv. Install Pipenv if you don't have it alreday:

.. code:: console

   pip install pipenv

Next, build the Pipenv virtual environment and install the requirements from ``Pipfile``. Be sure that you already have Python 3.6 installed on your system. If you have multiple versions of Python, this command will automatically search for Python 3.6.

.. code:: console

   pipenv install


Then, you can execute the main script directly:

.. code:: console

   pipenv run python3 main.py

Alternatively, you can build and run the binary:

.. code:: console

   pipenv run python -OO -m PyInstaller main.py -F
   dist/./main


Note that, although Pipenv automatically scans for the targeted Python version (Python 3.6), this may not give the desired result if you have multiple implementations of Python (for instance, CPython 3.6.8 and PyPy 3.6.9). In this case, you can specify the path to the correct Python version, for example:

.. code:: console

   pipenv --python /usr/bin/python3.6
