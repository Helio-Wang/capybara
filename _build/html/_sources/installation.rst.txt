Here we show how to download the GUI application.

For the installation process of the Python package, see the :ref:`Package installation` section in the relevant page :ref:`Python package`.


Download
--------

`Click here to get Capybara <https://github.com/Helio-Wang/Capybara-app/releases/latest>`__.

You can find the binary executables of Capybara for the following OS:

  - Microsoft Windows 10
  - macOs
  - Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Arch Linux, Manjaro, etc.)

Please note that no additional installation is required. Just unzip and double-click!

For some Linux versions: you might need to manually make the file executable in a terminal

.. code:: console

   chmod +x Capybara


Build
----- 

The source code is available at https://github.com/Helio-Wang/Capybara-app.

You may want to build Capybara from source if

  - You are not using one of the supported OS (Windows, macOS, major flavors of Linux), or
  - You have made some changes to the source code.


First, clone or create the project directory and

.. code:: console

   cd Capybara-app

Capybara includes a ``Pipfile`` specifying all requirements, generated by the virtual environment management tool Pipenv. Install Pipenv if you don't have it already:

.. code:: console

   pip install pipenv

Next, build the Pipenv virtual environment and install the requirements from ``Pipfile``. Be sure that you already have Python 3.6 installed on your system. If you have multiple versions of Python, this command will automatically search for Python 3.6.

.. code:: console

   pipenv install


Then, you can execute the main script directly:

.. code:: console

   pipenv run python main.py

Alternatively, you can build and run the binary:

.. code:: console

   pipenv install -d
   pipenv run python -OO -m PyInstaller main.py -F
   dist/./main


For Windows 10 users: you also need to install pywin32-ctypes with 

.. code:: console
   
   pipenv install pywin32-ctypes


Note that, although Pipenv automatically scans for the targeted Python version (Python 3.6), this may not give the desired result if you have multiple implementations of Python (for instance, CPython 3.6.8 and PyPy 3.6.9). In this case, you can specify the path to the correct Python version, for example:

.. code:: console

   pipenv --python /usr/bin/python3.6
